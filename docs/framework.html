<p>A coroutine is a function with a bookmark. Functions execute statements and return a value. Coroutines execute statements that can yield a value and set a bookmark.

## Finance

Market _instruments_ have _prices_ and _cash flows_.

Instruments _trade_ in units of _amount_. For example, stocks trade in shares,
bonds in terms of notional, exchange traded instruments specify contract size.

Each instrument _issuer_ determines its associated cash flows.

A _holding_ is an amount, instrument, and who owns it. Holders get
cash flows proportional to the amount held.

Trades result in _positions_: a collection of holdings.

A _trade_ is an exchange of holdings at some time between a _buyer_ and a _seller_.

Buyers decide when, what, and how much to trade. Sellers quote prices to buyers.

The price for a trade (after it has _settled_) is the ratio of buyer amount and seller amount.
It might not be the same as the quoted price (_slippage_).

Dynamic trading creates synthetic market instruments.
The values (mark-to-market) and amounts (trade blotter entries)
correspond to prices and cash flows, respectively, of the synthetic instrument.

## Mathematics

A _model_ specifies prices $X_t$ and cash flows $C_t$ for instruments
depending on what happens in the future. These are random
variables indexed by time: a stochastic process.

A _sample space_ $Ω$ is the set of what can happen in the future.
Partial information 
is specified by a _partition_ $\mathcal{A}$ of the sample space.
A function $X\colon Ω\to\bm{R}$ is $\mathcal{A}$-measurable if
it is constant on each element of the partition.
In this case $X\colon\mathcal{A}\to\bm{R}$ **is** a function on
the elements of the partition.

Let $E$ be the collection of all _entities_ (market participants),
$I$ be the collection of all instruments, and $A_i$, $i\in I$ be
the amounts at which instrument $i$ can trade. A _holding_ is
a triple $(a,i,e)$ where $e\in E$ is the entity owning amount
$a\in A_i$ of instrument $i\in I$. A _trade_ $(t;a,i,e;a',i',e')$
indicates buyer $e$ exchanged $(a,i,e)$ for $(a',i',e')$ with
seller $e'$. After the trade the buyer holds $(a',i',e)$ and
the seller holds $(a,i,e')$.

A _position_ is a collection of holdings. The _net ammount_ of is the
sum of the amounts of all holdings in the position for a given instrument
and entity. This assumes instruments are _fungible_: every
entity can convert $(a,i)$ to $(a_0,i)$ and $(a - a_0,i)$ at no cost.
This is close to being true if $a > a_0 > 0$.

A _trading strategy_ is increasing sequence of times and amounts of market instruments to trade.
It has associatd _values_ and _amounts_
Let $τ_j$ be the trading times and $Γ_j$ be the amount of
shares to trade in each instrument. Trades accumulate to
a _position_ $Δ_t = \sum_{τ_j < t} Γ_j$. The value of
the strategy at time $t$ is $V_t = (Δ_t + Γ_t)\cdot X_t$.
The amounts associated with a strategy at time $t$ are
$A_t = Δ_t\cdot C_t - Γ_t\cdot X_t$. They correspond to
the mark-to-market and entries in the trade blotter, respectively,
for the strategy.

## Implementation

Time corresponds to a datetime type, often in terms of UTC.
The difference of two times is an _interval_ or _period_.
A time and interval can be added to produce a time.
We have $t_1 = t_0 + (t_1 - t_0)$ for times $t_0$, $t_1$ and
interval $t_1 - t_0$. It is common to fix an _epoch_ $t_0$
and express time $t$ as an interval $t - t_0$ in units of years.

Price and cash flow are functions from $T\times \Omega\to\bm{R}^I$,
where $I$ is the set of instruments.

### Iterable

An iterable $i$ of type $T$ has three functions:
`curr:I -> T` giving its current value,
`next:I -> I` that removes the current value,
and `done:I -> Bool` indicating the iterable has no more values available.

## Usage

Examples of usage in a pseudo language:

```
    // At time t0 stock has price s0 and optional dividend schedule.
    stock S(t0, s0[, d0])
    // Geometric Brownian motion with volatility σ.
    model::bsm M(σ)
    // Put option with strike k and expiration t
    option::put p(k, t)
    // Value is a function of time and state given market instruments and a model
    v = value(p, S, M)(t0, ω0) 

```

Coding conventions

```
    namespace xyz {
        class C {
    public:

        static const char* doc = R"()";
        C()
        { }

        static const char* foo_doc = R"()";
        int foo(int)
        {
        }
    };
    }
```
