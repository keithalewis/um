# Accounting

We consider _accounting_ from a view toward
[valuing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/business-valuation.asp)
a company. A wholistic approach would consider societal issues such as
job creation, environmental impact, and quality of life, but we only
concern ourselves with the bean counting involved for an individual company.
The three primary _finanacial statements_ of a company to consider are
the _balance sheet_, _income statement_, and _cash flows_.

The balance sheet (assets = liabilites + equity) is a snapshot of companies
_assets_, _liabilities_, and _shareholder equity_.

The income statement (net income = revenue + gains - expenses - losses)
reports the _revenue_, _gains_, _expenses_, and _losses_ over a period of time.

Cash flows are all transactions over a period from _operations_,
_investments_, and _financing_ involved in accounting for the
cash going out of and coming into a company.
